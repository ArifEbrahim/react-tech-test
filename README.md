# AVAMAE tech test

This is my attempt at creating a website as close to the design provided in inVision.

## To run

Navigate to the root directly and type:

```
npm start
```

## Future work / issues

Maximum progress was made in the time given however not all features could be implemented. The following issues were found during testing and would be the focus of future work:

#### Home page

1. The default Swiper pagination & navigation buttons were used and do not match the inVision design.
2. The development was completed on my desktop computer using an external monitor. When I tested the app on my laptop & phone I noticed some of the images were not being resized properly, namely the carousel images on the 'Home' page and the background image on the 'Contact Us' page. I have included screenshots of the app in the 'images' folder as evidence that I was successfully able to get the design working on my machine.
3. Whilst the font 'Roboto' was selected in the style sheet it does not appear to be implemented correctly. Therefore there is a difference in the font when compared to the inVision design.

#### About Us
1. There is a missing link in paragraph one. This was not immediately implemented as all paragraph text was abstracted to variables to keep the code clean and therefore adding a link was not straightforward.

#### Contact us
1. Whilst the majority of the form was completed, I was unable to add the address fields in the time given.
2. During the tech test my focus was on implementing features and as a result I did not have time to refactor too much. Whilst some components were abstracted the code for this page is quite large and would benefit from some refactoring.
3. Basic form validation was implemented however this could be improved by using an external package such as React Hook Form.

## Thanks

I'd like to thank Avamae for the opportunity to complete this tech test. It was very challenging but also rewarding to see my solution come along.
