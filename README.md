# React tech test

An example tech test of building a multi-page website in React.

I have deployed the website [here](https://react-tech-test.netlify.app/)

Requirements:

Home page
- Has a carousel that displays images & text from an external API

About us
- Displays static content

Contact us
- Sends data to an external API
- Displays errors if server side validation fails

Notes:
- All styling done manually (no CSS frameworks used)
- Axios used for API calls
- Swiper used for the carousel 

## How to use

#### To install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/react-tech-test.git
$ cd react-tech-test
$ npm install
```

#### To run

```
$ npm start
```

## Future work

The weakest point of this website is it's responsiveness and this is what I'd look at next.
